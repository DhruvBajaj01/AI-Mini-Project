# AI-Mini-Project
 Pneumonia Detection

# Objectives
A computer-aided diagnosis system for
automatic pneumonia detection using chest
X-ray images has been developed in this project.
Deep transfer learning has been employed to
handle the scarcity of available data.
With 90% precision, the model is trained in such
a way that it detects pneumonia with the help of
chest X-ray images wherein, the dataset used is
this from Kaggle.
Hence, to address this problem and aid the
detection of this severe disease, our team has
created a pneumonia detection model using
deep learning (CNN)

# Technique
1. Image data gen basically used for rescaling, sizing,
turning into images fit for neural networks.
2. The model has used VGG19 which is an
object-recognition model that supports up to 19 layers of
cnn for image classification.
3. Then we used Residual Network (ResNet) which is a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that
overcame the “vanishing gradient” problem, It has
predefined weights which helps us in image
classification
4. Resnet is the best model over this dataset with proper
hypertuning of parameters
5. Speech API is used for voice-over output.
6. PyQt file is imported for graphic widgets and interface
to connect our backend model

# Importance
● Early detection of pneumonia disease can increase
the survival rate of lung patients. <br>
● Chest X-ray (CXR) images are the primarily means
of detecting and diagnosing pneumonia. <br>
● Detecting pneumonia from CXR images by a trained
radiologist is a challenging task. <br>

# Societal Benefits
● Pneumonia has caused significant deaths worldwide.<br>
● It is a challenging task to detect many lung diseases
such as like atelectasis, cardiomegaly, lung cancer,
etc., often due to limited professional radiologists in
hospital settings.<br>
● With this model, we can track pneumonia in its’ initial
stages and may lead to an increase in the survival rate
of lung patients.
